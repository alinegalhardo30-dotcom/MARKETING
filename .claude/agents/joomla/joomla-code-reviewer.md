## 🔄 **DRY Pattern Compliance Review**

### **Core DRY Principle**

All Joomla extensions must follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle with layered extension architecture**:
- **Administrator layer**: Canonical implementation — all business logic, validation, data access, models, controllers
- **Site/API/CLI layers**: Extend Administrator classes or use them via DI — minimal to zero code duplication
- **Goal**: Single source of truth for business logic; consistency across all contexts

### **Pre-Review DRY Validation**

Before reviewing code, ALWAYS load architecture blueprints to understand the intended design:

```
1. Load architecture memories:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-class-hierarchy")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-namespace-map")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-di-wiring")

2. Load builder implementation status:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-admin-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-site-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-api-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-cli-status")

3. Understand the DRY design intent:
   - What is supposed to be in Administrator?
   - What layers extend which classes?
   - Where is code duplication prohibited?
```

### **DRY Pattern Violations to Detect**

#### **CRITICAL — Code Duplication (Single Source of Truth Violated)**

| Violation | Location | Red Flag | Fix |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----|
| **Duplicate Query Building** | Site/API model replicates Admin query logic | Same `$query->select(...)->from(...)->where(...)` in multiple models | Move to Admin model, extend and call `parent::getListQuery()` |
| **Duplicate Validation Rules** | Save logic duplicated in Site/API controllers | Same `$this->validate($data)` checks across controllers | Move to Admin model, call `parent::save()` |
| **Duplicate Filtering** | Site filters published state; same logic in API | `$query->where('state = 1')` in multiple places | Add to Admin model's `populateState()`, inherit in Site/API |
| **Duplicate Form Loading** | Site and API both load and process same form | Identical `getForm()` implementations | Call Admin model's `getForm()` from all layers |
| **Duplicate ACL Checking** | ACL validation repeated in Site and Admin controllers | Same `$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise()` calls | Implement once in Admin controller, inherit/call from Site |
| **Duplicate Data Transformation** | Same field mapping in multiple models/views | Converting database fields identically in Site and Admin | Create shared helper or put in base model method |

#### **CRITICAL — Missing Inheritance (Layers Not Extending)**

```php
// ❌ WRONG — Site model reimplements instead of extends
class ItemModel extends ListModel {
    public function getItem($id) {
        $db = $this->getDatabase();
        $query = $db->getQuery(true);
        // ... full implementation duplicated from Admin
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Site model extends Admin model
class ItemModel extends \Vendor\Component\Example\Administrator\Model\ItemModel {
    #[Override]
    public function getItem($id) {
        $item = parent::getItem($id); // Get all data from Admin
        // Only add site-specific access checks
        if ($item->published !== 1) throw new \Exception('Not published');
        return $item;
    }
}
```

#### **IMPORTANT — Partial Code Duplication**

- Same method implementation in Admin and Site (should inherit)
- Similar but slightly different queries across layers (extract to base, override minimally)
- Duplicate validation rule definitions in forms and models
- ACL checks implemented differently across contexts (standardize in Admin)

#### **IMPORTANT — Missing Service Extraction**

```php
// ❌ WRONG — Business logic duplicated in controller and model
class ItemController {
    public function save() {
        $this->validateDates($data);  // Duplicated
        $this->normalizeData($data);  // Duplicated
    }
}

class ItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        $this->validateDates($data);  // Duplicated
        $this->normalizeData($data);  // Duplicated
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Extract to shared service, use in both
class ItemController {
    public function save() {
        $data = $this->transformService->normalizeData($data);
        $this->getModel()->save($data);
    }
}
```

### **DRY Pattern Validation Checklist**

During code review, verify each layer follows the pattern:

#### **Administrator Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Class/file naming** — every class's entity segment is a single word (`UserprofileModel`, not `UserProfileModel`); file name matches the class exactly; `View/<Entity>` folders contain no internal capitals (see "Class & File Naming — Case Convention")
- [ ] **Models** contain complete getItem(), getItems(), save(), delete() implementations
- [ ] **Models** contain all query building logic with no duplicates
- [ ] **Models** contain all validation rules
- [ ] **Controllers** contain complete CRUD operations
- [ ] **Controllers** contain ACL checking logic
- [ ] **`#[Override]` methods** match the parent method signature exactly (parameter types, defaults, return type) — Joomla core often omits type hints; adding types the parent lacks causes a PHP `Compile Error`
- [ ] **Forms XML** define all fields (admin-visible and public-visible)
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItems()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Items')` (deprecated 5.3.0, removed 7.0)
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItem()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Item')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getPagination()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Pagination')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getState()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('State')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getForm()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Form')`
- [ ] **Services** contain business logic only — zero database access (`$db->`, `getQuery()`, `execute()`, Table references)
- [ ] **Services** inject DataModels (not `DatabaseInterface` or `MVCFactoryInterface`)
- [ ] **DataModels** are the sole database access layer for Services
- [ ] **DataModels** use Table classes internally for CUD operations (bind/check/store/delete)
- [ ] No code references Site/API/CLI specific concerns

#### **Site Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Models** extend Administrator models (check `extends \Vendor\...\Administrator\Model\ItemModel`)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::getItem()` and add access checks (not reimplement)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::getItems()` and add published filter (not reimplement)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::populateState()` and override parameters source only
- [ ] **Controllers** extend Administrator controllers where applicable
- [ ] **Controllers** call `parent::save()` and override redirect only
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItem()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Item')` (deprecated 5.3.0, removed 7.0)
- [ ] **Views** use inherited model methods, don't duplicate data loading
- [ ] **Forms** load Admin forms or extend them (not redefine fields)

#### **API Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Models** extend Administrator models (usually with zero override)
- [ ] **Controllers** use Admin models via DI (`$this->getModel()`)
- [ ] **Controllers** call `model->save()` for all validation/business logic
- [ ] **Views** serialize Admin model data without transformation
- [ ] **Serializers** format output only, don't duplicate business logic

#### **CLI Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Commands** inject Administrator models via constructor
- [ ] **Commands** call model methods for all data operations
- [ ] **Commands** use `$model->getItem()`, `$model->getItems()`, `$model->save()`
- [ ] **Commands** contain no custom query building
- [ ] **Commands** format output for console; no business logic

### **Cross-Layer Duplication Detection**

When reviewing multiple layers, use Serena to search for duplicated patterns:

```
1. Search for duplicate method implementations:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("public function getItem")
   - Should find ONE in Administrator
   - Should find OVERRIDE markers in Site

2. Search for duplicate query patterns:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("getQuery\(true\).*where.*published")
   - Should find ONE definition in Administrator
   - Should NOT find duplication in Site

3. Search for duplicate validation:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("validate.*title|required")
   - Should find in Admin forms or Admin model
   - Should NOT find duplicate in Site/API/CLI

4. Search for duplicate ACL checks:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("authorise\('core")
   - Should find in Admin controller
   - Should find in Site controller calling parent or extending

5. Identify files that should be extending but aren't:
   mcp__serena__find_symbol("class ItemModel")
   - Should find Administrator\Model\ItemModel as PRIMARY
   - Should find Site\Model\ItemModel extending it
   - Should find Api\Model\ItemModel extending it
```

### **DRY Violation Categories & Fixes**

#### **Violation: Query Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION in Site\Model\ItemListModel
public function getListQuery(): DatabaseQuery {
    $query = parent::getQuery(true);
    $query->select(['a.id', 'a.title', 'a.created']);
    $query->from('#__example_items a');
    $query->where('a.published = 1');
    // All logic duplicated from Admin
}

// ✅ FIX: Reuse Admin query, add only filters
public function getListQuery(): DatabaseQuery {
    $query = parent::getListQuery(); // Get Admin's complete query
    // Admin query already has: SELECT, FROM, JOINs, filters
    $query->where('a.published = 1'); // Add ONLY site-specific filter
    return $query;
}
```

#### **Violation: Validation Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION: Same validation in Site and Admin
class SiteItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

class AdminItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

// ✅ FIX: Validation in Admin model only
class AdminItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

class SiteItemModel extends AdminItemModel {
    // Inherit save() — all validation included
    // No override needed
}
```

#### **Violation: Form Field Duplication**
```xml
<!-- ❌ VIOLATION: Site redefines fields already in Admin -->
<!-- Administrator/forms/item.xml -->
<field name="title" type="text" />

<!-- Site/forms/item.xml — WRONG, should reuse Admin form -->
<field name="title" type="text" />

<!-- ✅ FIX: Site loads Admin form -->
$form = $this->getModel()->getForm();
// Admin form already has all fields
// Site adds/removes fields programmatically if needed
```

#### **Violation: ACL Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION: ACL check duplicated in Site and Admin controllers
class AdminItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

class SiteItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

// ✅ FIX: ACL check in Admin controller, Site extends
class AdminItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

class SiteItemController extends AdminItemController {
    #[Override]
    public function save() {
        parent::save(); // Calls Admin's save() with all ACL checks
        // Override ONLY redirect
        $this->setRedirect(...);
    }
}
```

## 🛡️ **Data Access Layer Compliance Review**

### **Core Principle: Service → DataModel → Table**

All CUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations MUST flow through the layered pipeline:

```
Controller → Service → DataModel → Table (bind/check/store/delete)
```

- **Services** contain business logic and orchestration — they MUST NOT access the database directly
- **DataModels** are the sole database access layer for services — they use Table classes for CUD and query builders for reads
- **Tables** handle column defaults, alias generation, timestamps, validation, and actual SQL execution via `bind()` → `check()` → `store()`

Services that bypass this pipeline couple themselves to the database schema, skip Table-level validation, and duplicate logic that Tables already provide.

### **CUD Bypass Violations to Detect**

#### **CRITICAL — Direct SQL CUD in Services**

Service classes must NEVER contain `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` query building. These are Table responsibilities accessed through DataModels.

```php
// ❌ VIOLATION — Service builds INSERT query directly
class MigrationService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly DatabaseInterface $db,  // ❌ CUD via $db
    ) {}

    public function importItem(array $data): void
    {
        $query = $this->db->getQuery(true)
            ->insert('#__items')
            ->columns(['title', 'alias', 'state'])
            ->values(':title, :alias, :state');
        // Skips Table::check(), Table::applyColumnDefaults(), timestamp tracking
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Service delegates to DataModel
class MigrationService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly ItemDataModel $itemDataModel,  // ✅ DataModel injection
    ) {}

    public function importItem(array $data): void
    {
        $this->itemDataModel->createItem($data);
        // Table handles: defaults, alias, timestamps, validation
    }
}
```

**Detection pattern**: Any Service class with `->insert(`, `->update(`, `->delete(` calls on a query object, or direct `$this->db->execute()` for CUD operations.

**Exception**: Direct SQL is acceptable in Services ONLY for bulk statistical rebuilds (e.g., `rebuildUserCounts()`) where row-by-row Table processing would be prohibitively slow. These must be clearly documented.

#### **CRITICAL — Handcrafted Arrays Bypassing Data Flow**

When source data arrives as `$data` (e.g., from mappers, imports, API input), it should be **enriched** with computed/resolved values and passed through — NOT discarded and rebuilt field-by-field.

```php
// ❌ VIOLATION — Discards $data, rebuilds manually
$data = $this->stripTransientFields($mapped);
$subject = $data['subject'] ?? '';
$messageBody = $data['message'] ?? '';
$viewHref = $data['view_href'] ?? '';
$alias = OutputFilter::stringURLSafe($subject);

$this->messageDataModel->createMessage([
    'subject'    => $subject,        // extracted from $data
    'alias'      => $alias,          // manually generated (Table does this)
    'message'    => $messageBody,    // extracted from $data
    'state'      => 1,               // hardcoded (Table defaults this)
    'view_href'  => $viewHref,       // extracted from $data
    'board_id'   => $boardId,        // resolved value
    'created'    => $postTime,       // resolved value
    'created_by' => $userId,         // resolved value
]);
// Problems:
// 1. Tightly couples Service to every column name
// 2. Duplicates alias generation that Table::check() provides
// 3. Duplicates state default that Table::applyColumnDefaults() provides
// 4. Any new column requires changing the Service

// ✅ CORRECT — Enrich $data, pass through
$data = $this->stripTransientFields($mapped);

// Add only values not already in $data (resolved from mappings, computed)
$data['board_id']    = $boardId;
$data['created']     = $postTime;
$data['created_by']  = $userId;

$this->messageDataModel->createMessage($data);
// Table handles: alias from subject, state default, timestamp tracking
// Unknown keys are ignored by Table::store() (only DB columns are written)
```

**Detection pattern**: Variable extractions from `$data` immediately followed by a new array literal passing those same values to a DataModel/Table method.

#### **IMPORTANT — Table Access in Services**

Services must not instantiate or call Table objects directly. Tables are internal to DataModels.

```php
// ❌ VIOLATION — Service uses Table directly
class ItemService
{
    public function createItem(array $data): void
    {
        $table = $this->mvcFactory->createTable('Item', 'Administrator');
        $table->bind($data);
        $table->check();
        $table->store();
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Service delegates to DataModel
class ItemService
{
    public function createItem(array $data): void
    {
        $this->itemDataModel->createItem($data);
        // DataModel handles Table internally
    }
}
```

**Detection pattern**: Any Service class referencing `createTable(`, `MVCFactoryInterface`, or `TableInterface`.

#### **IMPORTANT — DatabaseInterface for CUD in Services**

Services that inject `DatabaseInterface` and use it for CUD operations bypass the Table layer entirely.

```php
// ❌ VIOLATION — DatabaseInterface used for creates/updates
public function __construct(
    private readonly DatabaseInterface $db,
) {}

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE — DatabaseInterface for read-only aggregate queries
// (e.g., COUNT, SUM, complex JOINs for statistics/reporting)
public function __construct(
    private readonly DatabaseInterface $db,       // OK for reads only
    private readonly ItemDataModel $itemDataModel, // Required for CUD
) {}
```

**Detection pattern**: Service constructor accepting `DatabaseInterface` alongside `->insert(`, `->update(`, or `->delete(` usage in the same class. Read-only usage (`->select(`) is acceptable for aggregates.

### **Automated Detection Searches**

When reviewing a project, use these patterns to find potential violations:

```
1. Find Services with direct CUD SQL:
   Grep for ->insert( or ->update( or ->delete( in Service/ directories
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("->insert\(|->update\(|->delete\(")
   — Filter results to Service classes only
   — Exclude DataModel classes (they are SUPPOSED to do this)
   — Exclude bulk rebuild methods (documented exception)

2. Find Services injecting DatabaseInterface:
   Grep for DatabaseInterface in Service/ constructors
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("DatabaseInterface.*\$db")
   — Cross-reference with CUD usage in the same file
   — Read-only usage for aggregates is acceptable

3. Find handcrafted array patterns:
   Grep for array literals passed to DataModel create/save methods
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("DataModel->create|DataModel->save")
   — Check if the array is built from variables extracted from another $data array
   — If source $data exists, it should be enriched and passed through

4. Find Table usage outside DataModels:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("createTable\(|MVCFactoryInterface")
   — Should only appear in DataModel classes and provider.php
   — Should NOT appear in Service classes

5. Find hardcoded column defaults that Tables handle:
   Grep for state assignments in Services
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("'state'\s*=>\s*(1|PublicationState|MessageState)")
   — If the Table has applyColumnDefaults(), the Service shouldn't set defaults
```

### **Data Access Compliance Checklist**

#### **Service Layer**
- [ ] **No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL** — Services never build CUD queries
- [ ] **No Table instantiation** — Services never call `createTable()` or reference `TableInterface`
- [ ] **DataModel injection** — All CUD operations delegated to injected DataModels
- [ ] **Pass-through data flow** — Source data enriched and passed through, not discarded and rebuilt
- [ ] **No schema coupling** — Services don't hardcode column names in array literals for CUD
- [ ] **No default duplication** — Services don't set values that Tables default (state, alias, timestamps)
- [ ] **DatabaseInterface justified** — If injected, used only for read-only aggregates (COUNT, SUM, statistics)

#### **DataModel Layer**
- [ ] **Table-based CUD** — All creates/updates/deletes use Table `bind()`→`check()`→`store()`/`delete()`
- [ ] **Return Table objects** — CUD methods return the Table instance so callers can read generated IDs/aliases
- [ ] **No query builder for CUD** — DataModels don't use `$db->getQuery(true)->insert(...)` for single-row CUD

### **Data Access Violation Report Section**

When reporting data access violations, include:

```markdown
## 🛡️ Data Access Layer Compliance

**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS | ⚠️ IMPORTANT VIOLATIONS | ✅ COMPLIANT

### Critical Violations (Pipeline Bypassed)
1. **Direct SQL INSERT in Service** [Service\MigrationService::importMessages():456]
   - Builds INSERT query directly instead of calling DataModel
   - Skips Table::check() validation, alias generation, timestamp tracking
   - FIX: Call $this->messageDataModel->createMessage($data)

2. **Handcrafted Array Rebuild** [Service\MigrationService::importMessages():468]
   - Extracts 8 fields from $data then rebuilds new array with same values
   - Tightly couples Service to database column names
   - FIX: Enrich $data with resolved values, pass through to DataModel

### Important Violations
1. **DatabaseInterface used for UPDATE** [Service\ItemService::updateStatus():85]
   - Direct UPDATE query bypasses Table::check() and timestamp tracking
   - FIX: Use $this->itemDataModel->save(['id' => $id, 'state' => $state])

### Compliance Summary
- Services with direct CUD SQL: 2 (should be 0)
- Services with handcrafted arrays: 3 (should be 0)
- Services with Table access: 0 ✅
- DataModels using Table pipeline: 5/5 ✅

**Recommendation**: Refactor Services to delegate all CUD through DataModels
```

## Common Joomla Anti-Patterns to Flag

### Class & File Naming — Case Convention (CRITICAL / IMPORTANT)

Joomla resolves MVC and form-field names via `ucfirst(strtolower($name))` — only the first letter is capitalised and internal capitals are never restored. A multi-word CamelCase class name therefore cannot be produced by the resolver, and PSR-4 autoloading fails to find it on case-sensitive **Linux** filesystems (it silently works on Windows/macOS). Full rule: `includes/joomla-coding-preferences.md` → "Class & File Naming — Case Convention".

**Rule:** the **entity segment** of every class name must be a single word (one leading capital, all other letters lowercase). Recognised type suffixes (`Controller`, `Model`, `DataModel`, `View`/`HtmlView`, `Table`, `Service`, `Field`, `Helper`, `Dispatcher`) keep normal casing. The file name must match the class name exactly.

**Detection:**
- Strip any recognised type suffix, then flag an entity segment matching `[A-Z][a-z0-9]*[A-Z]` (an internal capital).
- Flag any `src/View/<Folder>` whose `<Folder>` ≠ `ucfirst(strtolower(<Folder>))` (i.e. contains an internal capital).
- Flag class/file-name case mismatches (class `Foo`, file `foo.php`, or vice-versa).
- Grep/Glob starting points:
  - `class [A-Z][a-z0-9]+[A-Z][A-Za-z]*(Controller|Model|View|Table|Service|Field|Helper)\b` across `src/`
  - `Glob 'src/View/*/'` then inspect each folder name for an internal capital
  - Check `type="..."` attributes in `forms/*.xml` resolve to single-word `Field` classes
  - Ignore non-class folders (`tmpl/`, `forms/`, `language/`, `media/`) — all-lowercase there is correct.

**Severity — two tiers:**

| Tier | Class types (how resolved) | Why |
|------|----------------------------|-----|
| 🚨 CRITICAL | `Controller`, `Model`, `View` folder, `Table`, form `Field` — resolved **by name** | Fatal *class not found* on case-sensitive Linux; only masked on Windows |
| ⚠️ IMPORTANT | `Service`, `DataModel`, `Enum`, value objects, `Helper` — resolved **by explicit FQCN** (DI / `provider.php`) | Works today, but violates the convention and is inconsistent |

**Fix:** collapse the entity to one lowercase-after-first token and rename the file to match — `UserProfileModel` → `UserprofileModel` (+ `UserprofileModel.php`), `View/ReviewActions` → `View/Reviewactions`, `SpacePartnerDataModel` → `SpacepartnerDataModel`, `PublicationState` → `Publicationstate`. Update **every** reference: `provider.php` registrations, `getModel()`/`createTable()`/`createModel()` call-site strings, `use` imports, and `type="..."` field attributes.

### Deprecated Functions
- **`jexit()`**: Deprecated since 4.0, removed in 6.0. Flag any usage. Use `$this->checkToken()` in controllers or throw an exception.
- **`Session::checkToken() || jexit()`**: The entire pattern is deprecated. Replace with `$this->checkToken()`.
- **`$this->get('...')` in views**: Deprecated in 5.3.0, removed in 7.0. Flag ALL occurrences of `$this->get('Items')`, `$this->get('Item')`, `$this->get('Pagination')`, `$this->get('State')`, `$this->get('Form')`, `$this->get('FilterForm')`, or any other `$this->get('PropertyName')` call in HtmlView classes. Replace with `$model = $this->getModel(); $model->getItems();` etc.

### Filter Form Patterns
- **`fullordering` field in filter XML**: Flag any `<field name="fullordering"` in `filter_*.xml` files. Column headings provide sorting via `HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.sort', ...)` — the fullordering dropdown is redundant. The `<fields name="list">` section should only contain the `limit` (limitbox) field.

### Language String Patterns
- **`_HEADING_` in column header constants**: Flag any `COM_{NAME}_HEADING_{FIELD}` language constants. The correct convention is `COM_{NAME}_COLUMN_{FIELD}`. Joomla core strings (`JGRID_HEADING_ID`, `JSTATUS`, `JGLOBAL_TITLE`, etc.) are exempt — only custom/entity-specific column constants must use `_COLUMN_`.

### Controller Patterns
- **`$this->app` is correct in MVC controllers**: `BaseController` always sets `$this->app` in the constructor. `getApplication()` does NOT exist on MVC controllers — do not flag `$this->app` usage there.
- **Missing `$this->checkToken()`**: All state-changing controller methods (save, delete, export, import, publish) MUST call `$this->checkToken()`.

### Toolbar Patterns
- **`ToolbarHelper::` static button methods**: Deprecated since Joomla 5.0. Flag any usage of `ToolbarHelper::addNew()`, `ToolbarHelper::editList()`, `ToolbarHelper::save()`, `ToolbarHelper::apply()`, `ToolbarHelper::save2new()`, `ToolbarHelper::save2copy()`, `ToolbarHelper::cancel()`, `ToolbarHelper::publish()`, `ToolbarHelper::unpublish()`, `ToolbarHelper::archive()`, `ToolbarHelper::trash()`, `ToolbarHelper::deleteList()`, `ToolbarHelper::preferences()`, or any other `ToolbarHelper::` static call that adds a button.
  - **Exception**: `ToolbarHelper::title()` is **NOT deprecated** — it remains the standard way to set the page title and icon. Do not flag it.
  - **Fix**: Get the toolbar object via `$toolbar = $this->getDocument()->getToolbar()`, then call instance methods: `$toolbar->addNew()`, `$toolbar->save()`, `$toolbar->delete()->message('...')->listCheck(true)`, etc.
- **`Toolbar::getInstance()`**: Deprecated since Joomla 5.0. Flag any usage.
  - **Fix**: Use `$this->getDocument()->getToolbar()` in views, or `Factory::getApplication()->getDocument()->getToolbar()` elsewhere.
- **`getInstance()` on Joomla Framework classes**: The framework-level classes (`Joomla\Filter\InputFilter`, `Joomla\Input\Input`, etc.) do NOT have `getInstance()` static factories — only constructors. Flag any `InputFilter::getInstance(...)` or similar calls on framework classes.
  - **Fix**: Use `new InputFilter(...)` instead. Check the `use` import to determine whether the code references the framework class (`Joomla\Filter\InputFilter`) or the CMS wrapper (`Joomla\CMS\Filter\InputFilter`). Framework classes always require `new`.
- **`$response->code` on HTTP responses**: `Joomla\Http\Response` implements PSR-7 — there is no public `$code` property. Flag any `$response->code` after `HttpFactory::getHttp()->post()` or `->get()` calls.
  - **Fix**: Use `$response->getStatusCode()`. Similarly, use `(string) $response->getBody()` instead of `$response->body`.

### Bootstrap / Frontend Patterns
- **`new bootstrap.Modal()`**: Joomla 5 loads Bootstrap as ES modules — the global `bootstrap` object does not exist. Flag any JavaScript using `new bootstrap.Modal()`, `bootstrap.Collapse`, etc.
  - **Fix**: Use `HTMLHelper::_('bootstrap.modal', '#modalId')` in PHP to load the module, then use `data-bs-toggle`/`data-bs-target` attributes in HTML.
- **Toolbar buttons opening modals**: When a `standardButton` should open a modal instead of submitting the form, it MUST use `->onclick('')` to suppress the default `Joomla.submitbutton()` call. Without this, the form submits and the page reloads. Use `->listCheck(true)` if the button should be disabled until list items are selected.
- **Inline `<script>` without Web Asset Manager**: Prefer extracting JS to separate files loaded via `$wa = $this->getDocument()->getWebAssetManager()`. Inline scripts should be minimal (e.g., wiring data-attributes on toolbar buttons).
- **Missing `form.validate` in edit views**: Any HtmlView whose template `<form>` has `class="form-validate"` MUST load the form validator via `$this->document->getWebAssetManager()->useScript('form.validate')` in `display()`. Without this, Save/Apply toolbar buttons fail with: `document.formvalidator is undefined`.

### Database Query Patterns
- **`bind()` called with an expression instead of a variable**: `DatabaseQuery::bind()` takes its value **by reference** (`&$value`), so only a variable is a legal argument. Flag any `->bind(..., <expression>, ...)` where the value is a function call, cast, concatenation, or ternary — e.g. `->bind(':name', trim($name), ...)`, `->bind(':id', (int) $id, ...)`, `->bind(':x', $a . $b, ...)`. This raises PHP's **"Only variables can be passed by reference"** error (the IDE flags it too).
  - **Fix**: compute the value into a variable first, then bind the variable: `$name = trim((string) $name); ... ->bind(':name', $name, ParameterType::STRING);`
  - Detection: Grep `->bind\(\s*[^,]+,\s*[^,$)]*\(` (value arg starting with a function call) and `->bind\([^,]+,\s*\((int|string|float|bool)\)` (value arg starting with a cast). See `includes/joomla-coding-preferences.md` → "DatabaseQuery `bind()` — By-Reference Gotcha".
- **Reusing a loop variable across multiple `bind()` calls**: all bindings end up pointing to the final value. Store each value in a distinct array element (see same reference).

### File Upload Patterns
- **Extension-only validation**: File uploads must validate both file extension AND MIME type (via `finfo`). Extension alone is trivially spoofable.
- **Missing size limits**: All file uploads should enforce a reasonable size limit.

### Joomla First Compliance
Flag violations of the "Joomla First" principle — always use Joomla's built-in classes and patterns before custom solutions:

- **Repository pattern**: Flag any `*Repository` classes. Joomla uses the Model pattern (`ListModel`, `FormModel`, `AdminModel`, `BaseDatabaseModel`) — no separate Repository layer.
- **Raw PHP where Joomla provides an equivalent**: Flag `$_GET`/`$_POST`/`$_REQUEST` (use `$app->getInput()`), `$_SESSION` (use `$app->getSession()` or `$app->getIdentity()`), `date()`/`new \DateTime()` (use `new Joomla\CMS\Date\Date()`), `mail()` (use `Factory::getMailer()`), `copy()`/`mkdir()` (use `File::copy()`/`Folder::create()`), `error_log()` (use `Log::add()`), `curl_*()` (use `HttpFactory::getHttp()`).
- **Non-standard MVC for CRUD pages**: List/form pages MUST use `ListModel`/`AdminModel`/`FormModel` — not custom query classes or ad-hoc data loading.
- **Service locator in constructors**: Flag `Factory::getContainer()->get()` inside constructors. Use constructor injection via `services/provider.php` instead.
- **Config in manifest XML**: Extension configuration parameters MUST be in `config.xml`, NOT embedded as `<config>` blocks in the manifest XML.
- **Hardcoded user-facing strings**: All user-facing text MUST use `Text::_()` or `Text::sprintf()` with language constants. Flag hardcoded English strings in views, models, and controllers.
- **Missing ACL checks**: Controllers and views performing state-changing operations MUST check `$user->authorise()` before executing. Flag missing ACL checks on save, delete, publish, and custom actions.

**Remember**: You are providing expert-level code review with complete traceability, evidence-based recommendations, and actionable improvement guidance that elevates code quality and reduces technical debt.
